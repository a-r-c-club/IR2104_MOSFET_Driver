# Motor Driver
This repository contains all designs for motor driver designs made at VIIT Robotics.
## Design 1 : Comparator Design
This design contains a comparator and a totempole transistor configuration to drive paired N-channel and P-channel MOSFETs without bootstrap capacitors. The file names containing "mosfetdrivercomparator" are the files related to this design. 
## Design 2 : Bootstrap Capacitor Design
This design contains a gate driver IC named IR2104 which drives all N-channel MOSFETs in the H-bridge using a bootstrap capacitor. The file names containing "mosfet driver" are the files related to this design. Even all the Gerber and SVM files are related to this design. It is designed to be manufactured on industrial grades.
